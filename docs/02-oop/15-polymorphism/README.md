# Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. It allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface, enhancing flexibility and maintainability in complex software systems.

In professional Java backend development, polymorphism is essential for designing extensible, loosely-coupled systems. It enables behavior substitution, dynamic method binding, and clean abstractions for domain logic.

## 1. Definition

**Polymorphism** (from Greek: _poly_ = many, _morph_ = form) allows a single interface or method to represent different underlying forms (data types or implementations).

### Types of Polymorphism in Java

| Type                  | Description                                    | Example                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Compile-time (Static) | Method Overloading                             | Same method name, different parameters   |
| Runtime (Dynamic)     | Method Overriding (via Inheritance/Interfaces) | Subclass provides its own implementation |

## 2. Real-World Analogy

Consider a generic `PaymentProcessor`:

- A credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer all "process payments".
- Each has a specific way to do so, but can be handled through the same interface.

---

## 3. Code Examples

### 3.1 Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

```java
public class Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Log: " + message);
    }

    public void log(String message, int level) {
        System.out.println("Log [Level " + level + "]: " + message);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: `log()` is overloaded with different parameter lists. This is resolved at **compile time** based on method signatures.

---

### 3.2 Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

```java
abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        animal1.makeSound(); // Output: Bark
        animal2.makeSound(); // Output: Meow
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The variable type is `Animal`, but the actual object determines which `makeSound()` method is invoked. This is resolved at **runtime**, leveraging the power of **dynamic dispatch**.

---

### 3.3 Polymorphism with Interfaces

```java
interface PaymentMethod {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class CreditCard implements PaymentMethod {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card: $" + amount);
    }
}

class PayPal implements PaymentMethod {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal: $" + amount);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Checkout {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentMethod method = new CreditCard();
        method.processPayment(250.0);

        method = new PayPal();
        method.processPayment(125.5);
    }
}
```

**Key Insight**: This decouples the implementation from the interface, enabling **flexible substitution**, critical in scalable systems.

---

## 4. Best Practices

- **Program to interfaces, not implementations** – encourages flexible code and supports dependency injection.
- **Avoid deep inheritance trees** – prefer composition where applicable.
- **Use `@Override` annotation** – ensures the method actually overrides a superclass/interface method.
- **Keep interfaces focused** – follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

## 5. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                       | Why it's problematic                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Not using `@Override`         | May cause silent bugs due to method signature mismatch       |
| Overusing inheritance         | Leads to tight coupling and fragile hierarchies              |
| Assuming compile-time type    | May restrict polymorphic behavior when casting unnecessarily |
| Mixing overloading with logic | Can create confusing APIs if method signatures are ambiguous |

---

## 6. Professional Insights

- **Frameworks like Spring rely heavily on polymorphism**, especially through dependency injection and interface-based services.
- **Testability improves**: you can swap mock implementations during testing.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: polymorphism enables classes to be open for extension, closed for modification.

## 7. Summary

Polymorphism allows Java developers to write scalable, maintainable, and extensible code. Mastering it is crucial to achieving clean architecture and becoming a world-class backend developer.

| Feature           | Benefit                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Method Overriding | Behavior substitution       |
| Interface Usage   | Decoupling and flexibility  |
| Dynamic Dispatch  | Runtime behavior resolution |
