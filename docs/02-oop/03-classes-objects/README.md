# Classes and Objects

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **objects** are the fundamental building blocks of software systems. Understanding objects at a deep technical level is essential for crafting clean, reusable, and maintainable code, particularly in enterprise-level applications.

## What Is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a **class**. It encapsulates:

- **State** (data/fields/attributes)
- **Behavior** (methods/functions)
- **Identity** (a unique reference in memory)

Objects interact with each other through **method calls**, simulating real-world interactions. This abstraction makes software more modular, testable, and extensible.

## Technical Breakdown

### Class vs Object

- A **class** is a blueprint.
- An **object** is a concrete realization of that blueprint.

```java
// Class (Blueprint)
public class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}

// Object (Instance)
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.model = "Toyota Corolla";
myCar.year = 2020;
myCar.startEngine(); // Output: Engine started!
```

---

## Components of an Object

### 1. Fields (Attributes)

Represent the **state** of the object.

```java
String model = "Toyota Corolla";
int year = 2020;
```

### 2. Methods

Define the **behavior** of the object.

```java
public void startEngine() {
    System.out.println("Engine started!");
}
```

### 3. Identity

Each object has a unique memory address (identity), even if state and behavior are the same.

```java
Car car1 = new Car();
Car car2 = new Car();
System.out.println(car1 == car2); // false
```

## Example: Real-World Abstraction

### Modeling a Bank Account

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountHolder;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountHolder, double initialDeposit) {
        this.accountHolder = accountHolder;
        this.balance = initialDeposit;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) return;
        balance += amount;
    }

    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > balance) return false;
        balance -= amount;
        return true;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Using the Object

```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Alice", 1000);
account.deposit(500);
account.withdraw(200);
System.out.println(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1300.0
```

## Best Practices

- **Encapsulation**: Keep fields private and expose behavior via public methods.
- **Cohesion**: Group related data and behavior together in the same object.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each object should have a well-defined purpose.
- **Constructor Initialization**: Always initialize objects to a valid state.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                     | Explanation                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exposing internal state** | Avoid public fields. Use getters/setters if needed.  |
| **God objects**             | Don't make an object do everything. Keep it focused. |
| **Improper initialization** | Always ensure your object is valid when created.     |

---

## Professional Insights

- **Design to interfaces, not implementations.** Objects should expose contracts via interfaces, promoting loose coupling.
- **Use immutability where applicable.** Immutable objects are easier to reason about and safer in multi-threaded contexts.
- **Understand object lifecycle.** Especially in Java EE or Spring-based applications where object scopes vary.

## Summary

| Feature     | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object**  | A runtime instance of a class containing state, behavior, and identity. |
| **Role**    | Encapsulate logic and data into modular, reusable units.                |
| **Benefit** | Abstraction, encapsulation, reuse, and testability.                     |

Mastering objects is the first step toward writing scalable, maintainable, and testable backend systems. It lays the foundation for deeper OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.
