# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java — Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects" — self-contained entities that combine **data (fields)** and **behavior (methods)**. In Java, OOP is not just a style of programming but a foundational principle that underpins the language's design and ecosystem.

Mastering OOP in Java is critical for building scalable, maintainable, and testable backend systems. This document provides a rigorous introduction to the core principles, grounded in real-world backend development needs.

## Key Concepts of OOP

Java’s implementation of OOP revolves around the following four principles:

### 1. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and behavior within a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

- ✅ **Goal:** Protect internal state and promote a controlled API.
- 💡 **Access modifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`, `default`) are central to enforcing encapsulation.

```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Public getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **Abstraction**

Abstraction hides complex internal logic and exposes only essential features via interfaces or abstract classes.

- ✅ **Goal:** Reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes.
- 🎯 Use **interfaces** and **abstract classes** to define contracts.

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}
```

### 3. **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows one class to acquire fields and methods from another.

- ✅ **Goal:** Enable code reuse and model "is-a" relationships.
- ⚠️ Overuse leads to tight coupling and fragility — favor composition when reuse isn’t hierarchical.

```java
public class Employee {
    protected String name;

    public void work() {
        System.out.println(name + " is working.");
    }
}

public class Developer extends Employee {
    public void writeCode() {
        System.out.println(name + " is writing code.");
    }
}
```

### 4. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent type, promoting flexibility and scalability.

- ✅ **Goal:** Write extensible and flexible code.
- 👥 Two types: **Compile-time (method overloading)** and **Runtime (method overriding)**.

```java
// Runtime polymorphism example
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void process() {
        System.out.println("Processing payment generically.");
    }
}

public class CreditCardProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void process() {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment.");
    }
}
```

## Why OOP Matters in Backend Development

In modern backend systems, OOP is essential for:

- 📦 **Service modularity:** Break business logic into cohesive, loosely-coupled components.
- 🧪 **Testability:** Isolated behavior improves unit testing.
- 🔁 **Reusability:** Common behavior and logic can be extended or composed.
- 🔒 **Security and consistency:** Encapsulation protects system integrity.

---

## Professional Best Practices

- ✅ Prefer **composition over inheritance** for flexibility.
- ✅ Use **interfaces** to decouple implementations.
- ✅ Keep classes **single-responsibility** — avoid God objects.
- ✅ Leverage **immutability** when possible, especially in multithreaded code.
- ✅ Document **contracts** (interfaces) and **side effects** of methods.
- ❌ Avoid deep inheritance chains — they increase complexity and reduce maintainability.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Violating encapsulation by exposing fields directly.
- ❌ Using inheritance for code reuse without semantic “is-a” relationship.
- ❌ Ignoring abstraction layers — leaking implementation details.
- ❌ Relying on instanceof checks — violates polymorphic design.
- ❌ Overusing setters and getters as a form of procedural programming.

## Summary

OOP is not just about using `class` and `object`. It’s about building systems where responsibilities are well-defined, code is easy to reason about, and change is localized.
